(Issue Tracker System)


In modern project development and management teams, the chaos of task tracking leads to time loss, errors, and delays. Without a centralized system, tasks are "lost" in chats, emails, or spreadsheets, new tasks are often lost in the flow of new ones, and user roles are not taken into account. This is especially true for small and medium-sized businesses, where there is no budget for expensive tools like Jira, but flexibility and simplicity are needed.

We want to create a universal task and problem management system that will provide a single workspace for the team and allow flexible adaptation to different work processes.

To implement a web application where tasks are recorded, structured and go through a full lifecycle in a convenient and customizable form. The system will support user roles (for example, by profession), a task board (with sorting and tracking of application statuses), and the ability to adapt to specific company processes.
	
Our project will help businesses set up a managed development process, reduce errors and duplication of work, increase team productivity and improve the quality of the final product.
